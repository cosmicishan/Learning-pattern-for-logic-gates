# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
Solving Logic Gates using Neural Network implemented from scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Neural Network from scratch. The dataset used is Logical Gate AND. The Neural Network is built using activation function and a training function which iterates through the number of iterations provided by user and adjust the weights till it is adapted to the input. The Visualization of the training process is also done to show how the weights are updated at each iteration. The project is further extended to Logical Gate OR and the desired output is achieved.
